# **Analyzing Order Data Using Excel Pivot Tables and Charts**

## **Overview**
This project showcases advanced data analysis skills using MS Excel to analyze order data. By leveraging pivot tables and pivot charts, meaningful insights were derived through data aggregation and visualization. The project demonstrates essential Excel expertise, valuable for roles requiring data-driven decision-making.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Data Aggregation**: Summarize order data effectively using pivot tables.
- **Visualization**: Create pivot charts for clear visual representation of data trends.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Ensure data consistency and accuracy through pivot table functions.

---

## **Core Excel Functions Used**
1. **SUMIFS**
   - Sums values based on multiple conditions.
   - Example: `=SUMIFS($F$4:$F$216, $G$4:$G$216, J4)`

2. **SUM**
   - Adds up a range of cells.
   - Example: `=SUM(K4:K23)`

---

## **How the Formulas Work**
- **Populating the Green Column (K)**:
  - **Formula in Cell K4**: `=SUMIFS($F$4:$F$216, $G$4:$G$216, J4)`
  - This formula sums the values in the range F4:F216 where the corresponding values in the range G4:G216 match the value in cell J4.

  - **Formula in Cell K24**: `=SUM(K4:K23)`
  - This formula sums all the values from cells K4 to K23, providing a total for the green column.

- **Creating Pivot Table**:
  - Dragged the **Order Count** field to the **Values** area.
  - Dragged the **Rpt Dt** field to the **Rows** area.

- **Creating Pivot Chart**:
  - Based on the pivot table, created a pivot chart to visualize order counts over different dates.
