## **Core Excel Functions Used**
1. **ROUND**
   - Rounds a number to a specified number of digits.
   - Example: `=ROUND(A8,1)`

2. **TEXT**
   - Converts a value to text in a specific number format.
   - Examples:
     - `=TEXT(A10,"ddd")`
     - `=TEXT(A12,"mmm")`
     - `=TEXT(A13,"mmmm")`
     - `=TEXT(A14,"dddd")`

3. **LEFT, MID, RIGHT**
   - Extracts specific parts of a text string.
   - Examples:
     - `=LEFT(A18,2)&" "&MID(A18,3,3)&" "&MID(A18,6,5)&" "&RIGHT(A18,1)`
     - `=LEFT(A19,2)&""&MID(A19,4,3)&""&MID(A19,8,5)&""&RIGHT(A19,1)`

## **How the Formulas Work**

![Data Formatting Example](Project_08_Image.png)

- **Cell C8**: `=ROUND(A8,1)`
  - Rounds the value in cell A8 to one decimal place.

- **Cell C10**: `=TEXT(A10,"ddd")`
  - Converts the date in cell A10 to the abbreviated day of the week (e.g., Mon).

- **Cell C12**: `=TEXT(A12,"mmm")`
  - Converts the date in cell A12 to the abbreviated month name (e.g., Jan).

- **Cell C13**: `=TEXT(A13,"mmmm")`
  - Converts the date in cell A13 to the full month name (e.g., January).

- **Cell C14**: `=TEXT(A14,"dddd")`
  - Converts the date in cell A14 to the full day of the week (e.g., Monday).

- **Cell C18**: `=LEFT(A18,2)&" "&MID(A18,3,3)&" "&MID(A18,6,5)&" "&RIGHT(A18,1)`
  - Extracts and rearranges parts of the text in cell A18 with spaces.

- **Cell C19**: `=LEFT(A19,2)&""&MID(A19,4,3)&""&MID(A19,8,5)&""&RIGHT(A19,1)`
  - Extracts and concatenates parts of the text in cell A19 without spaces.
