## **Key Features**
- **Conditional Analysis**: Count and sum data based on specific criteria.
- **Data Aggregation**: Summarize employee records effectively.
- **Insightful Visuals**: Clear tabular representation of data for better understanding.

## **Core Excel Functions Used**
1. **COUNTIF**  
   Counts occurrences of a value in a specified range.  
   Example: `=COUNTIF($D$5:$D$217, J5)`  

2. **SUMIFS**  
   Sums values based on multiple conditions.  
   Example: `=SUMIFS($F$5:$F$217, $D$5:$D$217, J5)`  

3. **COUNTIFS**  
   Counts values based on multiple conditions across different columns.  
   Example: `=COUNTIFS($D$5:$D$217, J22, $H$5:$H$217, $K$21)`

## **How the Formulas Work**
- **COUNTIF**: Used to count occurrences of a single condition, such as specific roles or TRC codes.  
- **SUMIFS**: Aggregates data like total quantities for orders based on matching conditions (e.g., day or TRC).  
- **COUNTIFS**: Handles multiple conditions to extract deeper insights, such as day-wise employee activity breakdowns.

---

## **Insights Derived**
- **Daily Patterns**: Orders and quantities split across weekdays.  
- **TRC Code Analysis**: Aggregated data based on TRC codes.  
- **Comprehensive Summaries**: Total orders and quantities effectively visualized.
